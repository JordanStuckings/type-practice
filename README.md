# Type Practice

Type Practice is a Next.js App Router project that blends letter drills, multi-language coding snippets, and detailed stats to help you build typing accuracy and WPM. Tailwind CSS v4 drives the UI, while localStorage keeps your progress intact between sessions.

## Features

- **Lesson drills:** Letters unlock in sequence as you maintain your target WPM. Lessons hydrate from `public/full_dictionary_en.csv` (with a fallback word bank) so each unlock focuses on the newest character.
- **Coding snippets:** A curated `SNIPPET_LIBRARY` spans JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, and Ruby. Snippets highlight focus characters, preserve indentation, and track per-language performance plus streaks.
- **Profile analytics:** Dual-axis charts, accuracy distributions, highlight cards, and recent history summarize your progress. Filtering by individual letters helps spot weak spots.
- **Settings & persistence:** Target WPM, lessons-per-unlock, and preferred coding language are adjustable. Everything (including lesson/coding history) is stored under the `typing-progress-v1` localStorage key.
- **Static-friendly:** `next.config.mjs` is set up for static exports so the app can deploy to GitHub Pages or any static host without an always-on Node server.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies once:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server with hot reload on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` – run the production Next.js build (outputs to `out/` because `output: "export"` is enabled).
- `npm run start` – serve the production build locally if you want to mimic deployment behind Node.
- `npm run build:pages` – build, statically export, copy the result into `docs/`, and add a `.nojekyll` file for GitHub Pages.
- `npm run deploy:pages` – run the build:pages workflow and push `docs/` to a temporary worktree targeting `origin/gh-pages` (override destination via `DOCS_DEPLOY_BRANCH` / `DOCS_DEPLOY_REMOTE`).

> `docs/` stays ignored during normal development. Only force-add it (or rely on `npm run deploy:pages`) when you intend to publish the static build.

## Project Structure

- `app/` – App Router entrypoint (`layout.js`, `page.js`, `globals.css`). `page.js` contains the typing UI, coding mode, analytics dashboard, and settings forms. `snippetLibrary.js` holds the multi-language snippet data.
- `public/full_dictionary_en.csv` – word metadata powering lesson prompts. Update this file to customize vocabulary and scoring.
- `scripts/export-docs.mjs` – copies the static export in `out/` into `docs/`.
- `scripts/deploy-docs.mjs` – publishes `docs/` to the configured Git branch via a temporary worktree.
- `docs/` – holds the static site for GitHub Pages. Generated by `npm run build:pages`.

## Manual QA Checklist

- Complete lessons to ensure letters unlock, auto-advance works, and WPM/accuracy metrics record correctly.
- Switch to the coding tab, cycle snippets/languages, and confirm Tab/Enter helpers preserve whitespace and stats.
- Visit the profile tab to verify charts, streak calculations, and letter filters line up with your recent runs.
- Adjust settings (target WPM, lessons-per-unlock, coding language), refresh the browser, and confirm localStorage persistence.
- If you touch deployment scripts, run `npm run build:pages` to confirm `docs/` refreshes without errors before pushing.
